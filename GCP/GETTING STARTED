Why did we choose GCP in terms of security?
It is designed to provide security through the entire information processing lifecycle.
This infrastructure provides secure deployment of services, secure storage of data with end-user privacy safeguards, 
secure communications between services, secure and private communication with customers over the internet, 
and safe operation by administrators.

My roles:
Security leader who needs to understand Google’s key principles for Cloud Security and how they
can be applied and implemented to secure your own organization’s deployment

Security engineer who needs to understand how to configure and operate multiple different
security controls so that they correctly interact with one another

Risk and compliance officer who needs to understand the controls available on Google Cloud to
meet their business requirements and how those controls can be automatically deployed. You
also need to have visibility into controls drift and areas that need additional attention to meet the
regulatory needs of your business.


COMPLIANCE

We adopted three security principles that are the core of Google security
● Executing defense in depth, at scale, by default.
● Adopting the BeyondProd approach to infrastructure and application security.
● De-risking cloud adoption by moving toward a shared fate relationship.

-Defense in depth
there should never be
just one barrier between an attacker and a target of interest. Adding to this core principle, security should
be scalable, and security should be enabled by default.

Data is protected by
default through multiple layered defenses using policy and controls that are configured across
networking, encryption, IAM, detection, logging, and monitoring services.

As an example, the data in a production project by default has three levels of network protections: VPC
segmentation, VPC service perimeters, and firewall rules and policies. Data is further protected by
multiple levels of access protection using IAM, access context levels, and multi-factor validation of user
identities.

-BeyondProd
