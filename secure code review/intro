Secure code review is a crucial part of web app development. At TIPL, we are strong believers in security by design. Ensuring that
we prioritize security from the beginning is the best way to handle the situation, since it may be costly and time consuming
to implement it later. The main points that have to be covered in secure code review are the following. 
failures in identification, authentication and access control;
potential exposure of sensitive data;
inadequate error handling; and
all types of injection flaws.

I will now cover all of these in depth

failures in identification, authentication and access control;

Mishandling of identification and authentication can prove fatal for any web app out there. If an attacker manages to authenticate
as a root user, the damage they can cause could be irreversible. However, with proper access control policies, even if they
do manage to acquire root credentials, the damage could be kept to a minimum. With zero trust policies, each account is limited
to things they need and nothing more. This prevents lateral movement and reduces the attack surface. 
Furthermore, proper implementation of access control can help security personal pinpoint the source of a breach, and react
accoridingly. 

At TIPL, users login with their google accounts. Since we do not handle the authentication process, hackers would be unable to 
acquire the users passwords in the scenario that our systems are breached. Google has robust security implementations that
make their authentication process extremely secure and hard to circunvent. 

Internally, we have a clear separation of duties through role based access control. Within our Google Cloud Platform (which is the true
backbone of TIPL), we meticulously assigned roles based on the different areas we need covered. Each service account has limited access
based only on what they truly need, nothing more.
