Users sign in through Google Authentication, which is a widespread login method that is highly secure, since Google handles the data storage 
as well as the encryption. Since we dont directly store any passwords, Google Authentication takes a big load of us. In the scenario
that a hacker manages to acquire the google sign on for a user, they wouldnt be able to do much besides having access to the user's tokens
and previous queries.
