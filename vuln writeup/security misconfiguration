In order to reduce risks, we only included relevant functionalities within the site. In order to ensure that every component is always up to date
with the latest security patch, we implemented an automated update process. This protects us against zero day vulnerabilites, as well as any
previously unpatched vulnerabilities. A previously discovered vulnerability within the website was returning detailed error codes which displayed 
information that could be used to gain a foothold within the site. This has been patched and a generic error message is now displayed. 
Another vulnerability allowed attackers to list all the directories available within the site. This could be dangerous if an attacker manages to 
find a root directory which has no security configurations. This is not an issue since we ensured there are no directories that can be accessed 
throught the site that may be utilized to further establish a foothold. However, it is still a risk that we have to address.
