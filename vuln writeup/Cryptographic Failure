Cryptographic failure occurs whenever a web application exposes sensitive data due to a weak or a non-existent cryptographic algorithm. 
At TIPL we circunvented this issue by utilizing google authentication, so no user passwords or PII (personal identifiable information) is being stored withing our databases. 
The only things our databases store are emails, number of tokens, and previous queries that the users have executed. 
On top of that, our SQL databases are encrypted with AES-256 bit encryption (regarded as one of the most reliable encrypton algorithms)
, and we utilized a symmetric key which is stored safely. 
https?
certificate?
SSL?
